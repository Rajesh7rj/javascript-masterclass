===> Introduction and history

 Javascript is a scripting language introduced to make web pages alive and interactive 
 with the user. The interaction is possible due to the programs or scripts written along
 with HTML. Javascript was introduced by Brendan Eich, a Netscape employee. 
 
 Javascript at its development phase was called Mocha and was first shipped with 
 Netscape Navigator 2.0 as LiveScript. Finally, when Netscape Navigator 2.0 Beta 3
 was released, it was given the name Javascript. Javascript has come a long way 
 ie from client-side programming/frameworks (like Angular/React) to a server-side 
 technology like NodeJS in 2009.


===> What is ES?

In the year 1996, a standards organization called ECMA (European Computer Manufacturers Association) 
International carved out standard specifications called ECMAScript (ES), which all browser vendors 
could implement. And Javascript is the most well-known implementation of ES, while ActionScript 
(from Macromedia/Adobe Systems) and JScript (from Microsoft) are other implementations of ES.



====> List of Versions from ES

To date, ES has published nine versions, and the latest one (9th version) was published in the year 2018.

ECMA Script's first three versions- ES1, ES2, and ES3 were yearly updates, whereas ES4 was never released due 
to political disagreements. After a decade, ES5 was eventually released with several additions
